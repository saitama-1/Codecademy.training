Hurricane Analysis
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

Setup Instructions
